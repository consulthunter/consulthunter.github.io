This was a capstone project that I worked on with other seniors. The project was to develop a Android app version of the Infinite Jukebox. The app had to play a song for "forever" and demonstrate features similar to other media player applications. We developed the app and then presented our work to our professors. The presentation included a demonstration of the application.
