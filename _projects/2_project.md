I developed this for a company I worked for the goal was to dynamically/automatically inventory network devices. These devices were primarily Cisco products. I created Ansible playbooks to gather device information and then upload the information into Netbox. Once devices are in Netbox, I worked on a playbook that periodically checks device information using the device configuration.
