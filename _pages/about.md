      My name is Hunter Leary. I'm a graduate student in computer science. My research is in the software engineering domain.
      I grew up under the Blue Ridge mountains and have pretty much stayed around them my whole life.
      I got my BS in Software Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Virginia's College at Wise.
      Currently, I'm at Virginia Tech working with Dr. Chris Brown.
