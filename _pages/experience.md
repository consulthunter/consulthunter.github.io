I won't be listing companies or dates on this page. All of that information is already on LinkedIn.
Instead, I'll list the roles I've worked in and my primary responsibilities in that role. I will also say that I've had the priviledge of working with some amazing people in each of these roles.

## IT Infrastructure Intern

I mainly work with networking in this role. I use Ansible to perform configuration and device management. One of the cool things I did in this role is a network inventory. When I started they didn't really have a inventory of devices on the network, so my job was to create this for them. I used Ansible to reach out to the network devices and gather information (IPv4 address, hostname, VLANs, etc.) and then I used the NetBox module in Ansible to put this device information in the inventory source. The inventory source is DigitalOcean's NetBox application. The idea is to use Ansible to do a sort of dynamic inventory, periodically reaching out to devices to check configuration and then updating NetBox. Overall, this was a super cool project and I learned a lot.

## Graduate Teaching Assistant

I have various responsibilities in this role. It really depends on the class and this changes each semester. I mainly grade student assignments and work with students during office hours. I have also worked as a lab instructor. I would monitor students and help them with any problems during the lab. All of the classes I have been a GTA for were in computer science.

## Junior Cyber Security Administrator

This was an interesting experience. I took a class for this role while working on different projects. The class covered a variety of topics mostly involving networks and security, it was around 10 weeks long. The first project was developing a website for internal company marketing, it was developed using Perl. The second project I worked on was deploying Zabbix to different company servers. The goal of this project was to explore Zabbix as an alternative monitoring service for the company. During the projects, I was mentored by a senior employee.
